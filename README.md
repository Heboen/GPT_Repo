This repository contains small sample programs. The latest addition is a simple
terminal-based Minesweeper game written in Python.

## Playing Minesweeper

Run the game using Python 3:

```bash
python3 minesweeper.py
```

The game displays a 9x9 board with 10 hidden mines. Enter a row and column
(e.g. `0 1`) to reveal a cell. Reveal all safe cells to win; uncovering a mine
ends the game.
